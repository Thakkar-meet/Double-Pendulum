Simulation of a double pendulum.
Each pendulum consist of a point mass m hanging on an ideal string of lenght l in a constant, homogeneous gravitational field of acceleration g.
While the first pendulum is attached to a rigid, motionles point, the second pendulum is attached to the point mass of the first one:
